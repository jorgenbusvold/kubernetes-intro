## Inspection and logging
Ok, everything looks good!
But what if you need to inspect the logs and states of your applications?
Kubernetes have a built in log feature.

Let's take a look at our backend application, and see what information we can retrieve.

* View the logs of one container
  - First, list the pod names:
    
    ```
    kubectl get pods -l app=backend
    ```
    
    The flag `l` is used to filter by pods with the label `app=backend`.

  - Now, you can view the logs from one pod:
    
    ```
    kubectl logs <INSERT_THE_NAME_OF_A_POD>
    ```

  - You can also get all logs filtered by label.
      
    ```
    kubectl logs -l app=backend
    ```

* Ok, the logs were fine! Let's look at the environment variables set by Kubernetes in our containers:
  
  ```
  kubectl exec -it <INSERT_THE_NAME_OF_A_POD> -- printenv
  ```

  Here you can see that we have IP addresses and ports to our frontend service.
  These IP addresses are internal, not reachable from outside the cluster.
  You can set your own environment variables in the deployment specification.
  They will show up in this list as well.

* We can also describe our deployment, to see its statuses and pod specification:
  
  ```
  kubectl describe deployment backend
  ```
  
  Notice that `StrategyType: RollingUpdate` that we saw when we applied an updated frontend is set by default.


### DNS
A cool thing in Kubernetes is the Kubernetes DNS.
Inside the cluster, Pods and Services have their own DNS record.
For example, our backend service is reachable on `backend.<NAMESPACE>.svc.cluster.local`. If you are sending the request from the same namespace, you can also reach it on `backend`.
We will take a look at this.

* Get your current namespace

  ```
  kubectl config view | grep namespace: 
  ```

  If there is no output, your namespace is `default`.

* List pods to copy a pod name

  ```
  kubectl get pods -l app=frontend
  ```

* We will run `curl` from one of our frontend containers to see that we can reach our backend internally on `http://backend.<NAMESPACE>.svc.cluster.local:5000`

  ```
  kubectl exec -it INSERT_FRONTEND_POD_NAME -- curl -v http://backend.<NAMESPACE>.svc.cluster.local:5000
  ```

  The HTTP status should be 200 along with the message "Hello, I'm alive"

* Run `curl` from the same container to see that we can reach our backend internally on the shortname `http://backend:5000` as well

  ```
  kubectl exec -it INSERT_FRONTEND_POD_NAME -- curl -v http://backend:5000
  ```

  The output should be the same as above. 
  
* To fix the issue where we had to delete the frontend ReplicaSet to get the internal IP for the backend Service could be avoided if we used the DNS instead.
